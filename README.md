### Data Journalism and d3 visualization project.

The project involves gathering and analyzing data about the health risks facing
particular demographics. The data comes from the information collected U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

With the first two data types chosen, paste the value columns from each into a new Excel document.  To make sure you have a solid trend, you need to test for correlation with Excel's =CORREL() function.  Aim for a value either less than -0.5 or more than 0.5â€”these values would indicate a moderate correlation and a story that might be worth pursuing (shoot for -0.75 or 0.75 if you're super diligent).

Using the D3 techniques, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements.

When the d3.html displays the graphic as you'd like it to, embed it an index.html with an iframe.

*For testing, from Git-Bash, >python http.server -m 8000, then from a browser, localhost:8000.*
